Examples
========

All examples build upon the `main_example.asm` provided here - it's the basic boilerplate.

To avoid duplication, the `Delay.asm` file here is shared by all the examples.

The `Makefile`s in the example projects work with KEIL installed in Wine.

If you are using KEIL on Windows, create a new project and copy the `.asm` and `.s` files into it.
